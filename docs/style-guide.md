# Tab Bankruptcy Style Guide

## Design Principles

### No AI Vibes
- Write like a human
- No corporate speak or marketing fluff
- Be direct and helpful
- Avoid phrases like "leverage," "empower," "revolutionize"

### Visual Style

**Colors**
- Background: `#1a1a1a` (dark)
- Secondary background: `#2a2a2a`
- Text: `#e5e5e5` (light gray)
- Subdued text: `#888`, `#666`
- Accent: `#10b981` (green) - use for CTAs, highlights
- **NO BLUE** - we're not another generic tech product

**Typography**
- Font: Inter
- Weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold)
- Keep it readable - 14px base for UI, 13px for secondary text

**Layout**
- Clean and minimal
- Generous whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy
- No unnecessary decoration

### Voice & Tone

**Copy**
- Short sentences
- Active voice
- Assume intelligence (don't over-explain)
- Humor is fine if it's natural

**Examples**

✅ Good:
- "Close all tabs older than 7 days"
- "No old tabs!"
- "Declare bankruptcy"

❌ Bad:
- "Leverage our innovative solution to optimize your browsing experience"
- "Experience the power of intelligent tab management"
- "Your tabs have been successfully processed"

### UI Patterns

**Buttons**
- Primary action: Green (#10b981)
- Secondary action: Dark gray (#2a2a2a)
- Destructive action: Same as secondary (no red - keep it minimal)

**States**
- Empty states should be friendly, not anxious
- Confirmations should be clear about consequences
- No spinners unless absolutely necessary

**Interactions**
- Fast and responsive
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Hover states for everything clickable
- Clear feedback for actions

## Technical

- Keep it simple
- No build tools unless absolutely necessary
- Vanilla JS preferred
- Progressive enhancement
- Performance matters
